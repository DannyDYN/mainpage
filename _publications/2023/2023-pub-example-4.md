  This study discusses the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on inbound tourism from China, aiming to investigate its prospects during the post-pandemic period. After briefly reviewing trends concerning COVID-19 impact studies at home and abroad, basic results from two cross-sections of web-based data in 2020 and 2022 are introduced to identify how the pandemic impacted not only daily activity and travel patterns but also the intentions of visiting Japan in the post-pandemic period. Finally, we summarize the challenges that we should verify to support inbound tourism restoration policies.
