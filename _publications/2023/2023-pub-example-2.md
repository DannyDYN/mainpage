  This study was proposed to explore imparities in public transport use, quality assessment, interchange experience, and their correlation with travel satisfaction. Methods: 3538 respondents completed an online questionnaire across urban districts of Hangzhou, China. The modeling process included: 1) statistical analysis, 2) construction of a LightGBM model with parameters optimized via Optuna framework, and 3) SHAP-based synergy analysis and visualization on travel satisfaction regarding quality perceptions of public transport services, interchange experiences, and daily mobility. Results: Daily travel mode, age, transport info inquiry methods, and ride and interchange experiences were the top factors affecting travel satisfaction. The use and knowledge of the metro varied among generations, with a watershed at age 40, where older individuals exhibited enhanced travel satisfaction through taking the metro on daily trips. Channels for acquiring transport information (smartphone apps, toll-free hotlines, websites, etc.) were negligent in ensuring the consistency of information with actual scenarios. As passengers used inquiry services more frequently, reports of deficiencies in interchange guidance increased substantially, leading to spoiled travel satisfaction. Further, satisfaction improvement of the interchange process failed to mitigate the negative effect of augmented interchange time consumption on travel satisfaction. Respondents who took public transport for more than 15 trips a week reported a significantly higher number of dreadful bus rides, particularly the discomfort brought by the start/stop of electric buses. Conclusions: Simpler access to the metro, more streamlined transport information flow, and smoother interchange procedures could contribute to better travel satisfaction across populations.
