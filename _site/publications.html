Methods: 3538 respondents completed an online questionnaire across urban districts of Hangzhou, China. The modeling process included: 1) statistical analysis, 2) construction of a LightGBM model with parameters optimized via Optuna framework, and 3) SHAP-based synergy analysis and visualization on travel satisfaction regarding quality perceptions of public transport services, interchange experiences, and daily mobility. Results: Daily travel mode, age, transport info inquiry methods, and ride and interchange experiences were the top factors affecting travel satisfaction.

            <p class="mt-0 mb-0 small text-muted">Travel mode choice prediction is essential for transportation planning and travel demand prediction. One of the conventional travel survey methods is collecting data over landline telephones, which lacks efficiency because of financial and time resource needs. In this regard, smartphone-assisted travel surveys can be applied to overcome the mentioned deficiencies. Smartphone-assisted travel surveys allow respondents to record GPS data, travel purpose, and travel mode via an application, simplifying the survey process. With various sensors equipped, the precision of data is ensured. Based on the survey results, varied approaches have been seen to travel mode identification. For this study, a travel survey was conducted in Hangzhou, China, supported by the smartphone application TraceRecord integrated with online mapping services. Several steps were undertaken to recognize different kinds of travel modes. First, preprocessing was adopted to screen out defective logs. With the employment of A-Map Application Programming Interface (API), trajectory segmentation was substantially boosted. Then, separately, features related to velocity, acceleration, and heading were extracted from the survey data. To achieve better accuracy and efficacy, two classification algorithms—support vector machine (SVM) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)—were applied to model the travel mode identification problem. Compared with the SVM, GBDT produced a higher prediction accuracy of 90.16%. Further analysis was implemented based on the results of the GBDT model, and velocity-related features contributed the most to the identification problem. The study explores the possibility of applying travel mode recognition in real-world conditions and discusses further mining of the survey data.</p>

            <p class="mt-0 mb-0 small text-muted d-none d-sm-block">Travel mode choice prediction is essential for transportation planning and travel demand prediction. One of the conventional travel survey methods is collecting data over landline telephones, which lacks efficiency because of financial and time resource needs. In this regard, smartphone-assisted travel surveys can be applied to overcome the mentioned deficiencies. Smartphone-assisted travel surveys allow respondents to record GPS data, travel purpose, and travel mode via an application, simplifying the survey process. With various sensors equipped, the precision of data is ensured. Based on the survey results, varied approaches have been seen to travel mode identification. For this study, a travel survey was conducted in Hangzhou, China, supported by the smartphone application TraceRecord integrated with online mapping services. Several steps were undertaken to recognize different kinds of travel modes. First, preprocessing was adopted to screen out defective logs. With the employment of A-Map Application Programming Interface (API), trajectory segmentation was substantially boosted. Then, separately, features related to velocity, acceleration, and heading were extracted from the survey data. To achieve better accuracy and efficacy, two classification algorithms—support vector machine (SVM) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)—were applied to model the travel mode identification problem. Compared with the SVM, GBDT produced a higher prediction accuracy of 90.16%. Further analysis was implemented based on the results of the GBDT model, and velocity-related features contributed the most to the identification problem. The study explores the possibility of applying travel mode recognition in real-world conditions and discusses further mining of the survey data.</p>

            <p class="mt-0 mb-0 small text-muted">Passenger transportation is one of the primary sources of urban carbon emissions. Travel data acquisition and appropriate emission inventory availability make estimating high-resolution urban passenger transportation carbon emissions challenging. This paper aims to establish a method to estimate and analyze urban passenger transportation carbon emissions based on sparse trip trajectory data. First, a trip chain identification and reconstruction method is proposed to extract travelers' trip information from sparse trip trajectory data. Meanwhile, a city-scale trip sampling expansion method based on population and checkpoint data is proposed to estimate population movements. Second, the identified trip information (e.g., trip origin and destination, and travel modes) is used to calculate multimodal passenger transportation CO2 emissions based on a bottom-up CO2 emissions calculation approach. Third, we develop a multi-scale high-resolution transportation carbon emission calculation and monitoring platform and take the city of Hangzhou, one of China's leading cities, as our case study, with around 10 million daily trips data and a quarter million road links. Five modes of passenger transportation are identified, i.e., walking, cycling, buses, metro, and cars. Hourly carbon emissions are calculated and attributed to corresponding road links, which build up passenger transportation carbon emissions from road links to region and city levels. Results show that a typical working day's total passenger transportation CO2 emission is about 36,435 tonnes, equivalent to CO2 emissions from 4 million gallons of gasoline consumed. According to our analysis of the carbon emissions produced by approximately 40,000 km of roadways, urban expressways have the most hourly carbon emissions at 194 kg/(h·km). Moreover, potential applications of the developed methods and platform linking to smart mobility management (e.g., Mobility as a Service, MaaS) and how to work in tandem to support green transportation policies (e.g., green travel rewards and carbon credits in transportation) have been discussed.</p>

            <p class="mt-0 mb-0 small text-muted">COVID-19 had a devastating impact on people's work, travel, and well-being worldwide. As one of the first countries to be affected by the virus and develop relatively well-executed pandemic control, China has witnessed a significant shift in people's well-being and habits, related to both commuting and social interaction. In this context, what factors and the extent to which they contribute to well-being are worth exploring. Through a questionnaire survey within mainland China, 688 valid sheets were collected, capturing various aspects of individuals' life, including travel, and social status. Focusing on commuting and other factors, a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) model was developed based on 300 sheets reporting working trips, to analyze the effects on well-being. Two indicators, i.e., the Relative Importance (RI) and Partial Dependency Plot (PDP), were used to quantify and visualize the effects of the explanatory factors and the synergy among them. Commuting characteristics are the most critical ingredients, followed by social interactions to explain subjective well-being. Commuting stress poses the most substantial effect. Less stressful commuting trips can solidly improve overall well-being. Better life satisfaction is linked with shorter confinement periods and increased restriction levels. Meanwhile, the switch from in-person to online social interactions had less impact on young people's life satisfaction. Older people were unsatisfied with this change, which had a significant negative impact on their life satisfaction. From the synergy of commuting stress and commuting time on well-being, the effect of commuting time on well-being is mediated by commuting stress in the case of China. Even if one is satisfied with online communication, the extent of enhancement on well-being is minimal, for it still cannot replace face-to-face interaction. The findings can be beneficial in improving the overall well-being of society during the pandemic and after the virus has been eradicated.</p>
